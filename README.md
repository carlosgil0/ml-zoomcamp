# ml-zoomcamp
This repository contains solutions and exercises for the ML Zoomcamp course.

## Assignments

*   [**hw1.py**](hw1.py): Covers basic data exploration, pandas operations, handling missing values, and a simple linear algebra exercise.
*   [**hw2.py**](hw2.py): Focuses on data splitting, implementing linear regression from scratch, and evaluating models using RMSE.
*   [**hw3.py**](hw3.py): Explores logistic regression, one-hot encoding for categorical features, feature elimination, and hyperparameter tuning for regularization (C parameter).
*   [**hw4.py**](hw4.py): Explores logistic regression with `DictVectorizer`, evaluates model performance using ROC AUC, precision-recall curves, and implements K-Fold cross-validation for robust evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.
